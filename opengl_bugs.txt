  After introducing the msaa offscreen buffer and the indermidiate 
  post processing buffer, the screen did not render the cube, though it did
  render the background.
  I used renderdoc for the first time for this. I had another program where
  I had made this work, only now I was trying a different renderer setup, so I was comparing
  both.
  When I was inspecting the glDrawArrays, I noticed that, when setting the matrix uniforms,
  it said "no resource" on the program argument. Now I know that the matrices aren't being set,
  so my best guess is that the shader programs are defaulting the matrices to 0, and when 
  multiplying them by the vertices, they also become 0. 
  The problem at the end was that I wasn't setting the glUseProgram before setting the 
  uniforms. I thought that because I was passing the u32 program_shader, it would set them
  on the shader, but turns out I actually need to set the shader beforehand, and by setting the
  state, opengl now knows which programs these uniforms belong to.
